# TW_Linked_List

This project implements a singly linked list in C++ using template classes, allowing for storage of different data types. The project includes the following features:

- Node and LinkedList class definitions.
- Functions for common operations such as inserting, removing, and finding elements.
- Proper memory management and exception handling for robustness.
- Demonstration of LinkedList functionality in the main() file.

It also includes features of a stack recreated through a vector, which are equally demonstrated in the main file.
